# Code History - SwiftUI Project

Submitted by: **Ibrahim Awoleiro**

This Swift app was part of my Swift Path on Codecademy.

## Overview

Welcome to **Code History**! In this project, I built an engaging app where users answer questions about coding history. This project helped me learn more about Swift and SwiftUI, and how to create interactive and dynamic user interfaces.

**Code History** features a Game model, Question model, and a Score view. The app changes the screen color to green if the user answers correctly, and to red if the user answers incorrectly, providing immediate feedback.

By working on this project, I gained valuable experience in building interactive iOS applications. Let's get started!
